# Asking For Help

## During Normal Weeks

Outside of Office Hours, you can always ask any instructor any question over the course of the day. Slack is the most effective way to communicate with instructors. Remember to use the channels set up for you.

We ask that you take the following steps when dealing with technical questions...

1. Try something else
2. Google your exact problem or error
3. Ask another classmate
4. Ask an instructor

If your question is **non-technical** -- you're feeling overwhelmed, or you have questions about a homework or project prompt -- please reach out directly to an instructor or Leah as soon as possible! We are here for you!

**After 5:30pm**, aside from [office hours](office-hours.md), instructors may not be able to respond to technical questions until the following morning.

## During Project Weeks

GitHub issues are the most useful method for answering technical questions. Please be specific, submit code, and give us time to respond -- especially if there are multiple issues in queue. It is expected that you will try to debug/solve an issue prior to submitting a request for help on Github.

Issues should follow this format:
```
I tried ___.
I expected ___ to happen.
___ happened instead.
My repo link is ___ and my question is about lines ___.
```

**Note:** Issues will be closed once a solution has been reached and can only be reopened by instructors. Therefore, should your issue get closed, please create a *new* issue, and if it's applicable to your previous issue, just include a link to the previous issue.

### Why Issues?

Many reasons! The biggest is that programmers often have the same question. This way, students with the same question can find their answer in one place.

Additionally, having to articulate the question into words is very helpful in understanding the problem. Sometimes, simply articulating the question gives you the answer!

Lastly, you will be required to use issues on the job, especially on teams. This is good practice in getting into the habit. No manager will response to a poorly asked issue.

#### Context

When submitting an issue, please provide some context as to what the problem is. This includes but is not limited to:
- What user story you are currently working on
- What you are trying to do (in terms of code)
- Detailed description of the bug or error
- Relevant code/files/errors (and screenshots if applicable)
- Libraries and/or other technologies being used (if applicable)

#### Approaches Tried

Give information about what you have done to solve the problem. Including but not limited to:
- Documentation you have looked at
- Steps you have taken to solve the problem
- Resources you have used

### Can students respond to other students' issues?
**YES!**

### So, when *should* I seek out an instructor in-person?
**We really want you talk to us when it's an emotional issue** more than a technical one.

For technical problems, seek us out in person when you've submitted an issue, and have spent more than 15 minutes trying to solve the problem yourself, 15 minutes Googling, and 15 minutes asking other students for help (in-person, on Slack, etc).
