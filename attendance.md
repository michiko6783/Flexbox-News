# Attendance

## Policy

You will take your own attendance through Garnet while on the `WeWork` or `WWGuest` wifi network. Please check [the graduation requirements for arriving on-time](graduation-requirements.md#attendance)!

If today begins at 9:00AM, then any attendance taken at 9:01 will be considered "tardy". Attendance cannot be taken three hours after the start time. That is: if you try to take attendance at 12:01, you will be considered "absent".

**There are no exceptions, even if you forgot and the instructors saw you were here.**

## How To Remember To Check In

- [Slack Reminders](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/208423427-Setting-reminders)
- [Google Calendar Reminders](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6285327?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
- Remind each other!

Of course, traffic delays can happen. The solution is to leave every day earlier than you think you should. The instructors are on-time every day and we live all over the area. **If the instructors can do it, so can you!**

If you do arrive late, please enter the classroom quietly and sit in the back. Having folks coming in late is a huge distraction to the instructors and students.

This button will only be available for one hour after the beginning of the day. After that hour, you will be considered absent.
