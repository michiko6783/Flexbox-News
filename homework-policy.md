# Homework Policy

- Homework will take more time for some, and less time for others. It is up to you how you want to partition your time for a given exercise. You will generally be assigned homework every day.

- Turn in **something**. Turning in an incomplete assignment is **infinitely** better than turning in nothing at all. **We rely on homework to know where you're at.** It's very much to your advantage to turn in your homework the day it's assigned, even if -- *especially* if -- you're not able to finish it. Then we can address concerns before the unit continues and keep you from falling behind.

- Each assignment will ask you to learn or research something that has explicitly not been covered in class. Learning how to learn is fundamental to becoming a successful developer.

- Homework is graded only on **meaningful progress**. That is: that you made an effort to complete it, regardless of whether you were successful.

- Plagiarized homework will not be accepted.

> Concerned about what is considered plagiarism? Consult an instructor.

- Assignments are graded on whether or not you seem to have made a meaningful effort to do them. There are three possible grades for each assignment:
  - **Complete:** something was turned in, and meaningful effort was made.
  - **Incomplete:** something was turned in, but meaningful effort was not made: the submission is blank, or it was blatantly copied wholesale from somewhere.
  - **Missing:** nothing was turned in.

- **Feedback** will not be given on assignments by an instructor unless you specifically request it. Requests for feedback, however, are encouraged. To make a request, you will need to submit a github issue on the main homework repository. On the main repo, click the 'issues' tab at the top, then the green button that says "New Issue". Please be very specific in your requests.

  For example:

  > Any thoughts as to why the method on line 49 kept returning 'NaN'?

- You can track your homework completion rate in [Garnet](http://garnet.wdidc.org).
